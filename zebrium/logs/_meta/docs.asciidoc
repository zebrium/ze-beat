This is the `logs` metricset of the RabbitMQ module and collects metrics
about RabbitMQ logss.

The metricset has two modes to collect data which can be selected with the
`logs.collect` setting:

* `logs`: collects metrics only from the logs `metricbeat` connects to. This is the
  default, as it is recommended to deploy `metricbeat` in all logss.
* `cluster`: collects metrics from all the logss in the cluster. This is recommended
  when collecting metrics of an only endpoint for the whole cluster.
